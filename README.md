# Depth-migration-simulation
Simulate depth migration behavior in an organism across a thermally stratified water column. Pass that behavior through a time averaging measurement method and plot results. This was orignially written to simulate depth migration in extant Nautilus (e.g. Ward et al., 1984 and Carson et al., 1984).

Model parameters that can vary include:

Water column temperature with depth

Input behavior - Sinusoidal to bound random walk

Time averaging and analysis precision
